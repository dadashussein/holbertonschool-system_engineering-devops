<h3>1 - Web Server, Application Server, and Database Server</h3>
<p>These components represent the fundamental tiers of a typical web application architecture: presentation (web server), business logic (application server), and data storage (database server)</p>
<h3>2 - Load Balancer</h3>
<p>It improves the performance, reliability, and scalability of the application by evenly distributing the workload and avoiding overloading any single server</p>
<h3>3 - Why HAProxy is Configured as a Cluster</h3>
<p>Configuring HAProxy as a cluster involves deploying multiple instances of HAProxy and configuring them to work together.
Clustering HAProxy provides redundancy and fault tolerance, ensuring continuous availability of the load balancing service.
In case of a failure in one HAProxy instance, the remaining instances can handle the incoming traffic without interruption, thus maintaining the availability of the application.</h3>
<p>The monitoring tool collects data by periodically querying system metrics, application logs, and network traffic. It may use agents installed on servers or APIs provided by the infrastructure and applications to gather information.</p>
<h3>4 - Split Components with Their Own Servers</h3>
<p>Splitting the components into separate servers ensures isolation, security, and scalability.
Web servers are dedicated to serving static content and handling HTTP requests, allowing them to be optimized for web traffic.
Application servers host the dynamic components of the application, enabling efficient processing of business logic and server-side scripting.
Database servers manage the application's data, providing storage and retrieval services optimized for database operations.
Separating these components allows for independent scaling based on the specific requirements of each tier, optimizing resource utilization and improving overall performance.</p>
